# JWT with Amazon Cognito

We use Amazon Cognito as our Identity Provider `IdP`.  During your onboarding process you should have recevied a username and password which was generated by Amazon Cognito.


## SSO Single-Sign-On Support
Cognito can be integrated with your federated `IdP` single-sign-on `sso`.  If you require `sso` please reach out to our support team.  Please note, this will require an upgraded account.

## Obtainng a JWT
JWTs can be obtained via using standard username/password flow (`ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`),  Secure Remote Password flow (`ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH`) or via a `client id` and `client secret` which is typically used for automated solutions.

Whichever method you use it's imporant to keep these values confidential.

## Connecting to Amazon Cognito

No matter what tool you use (Java, Python, c#, R, Ruby, php, curl, etc), connections to Amazon Cognito are essentially https calls.

To keep it simple here is an example usign curl in shell command.
