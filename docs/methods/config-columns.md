(image of data columns configuration screen)\

A description of each setting on the Data Columns configuration screen is below:

|Field name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Time|Sample time for analysis|
|Unique Subject/Animal Identifier|Unique identifier for each subject or animal. If there are multiple profiles for a single subject (e.g. mutliple formulations), use the Grouping variables also.|
|Observed concentration|Observed concentration that includes text designations for samples below the limit of quantitation or missing samples|
|Analyzed concentration|Concentration to be used in the calculation of PK parameters. Imputations for missing samples and/or samples below the limit of quantation must be made in this column|
|Grouping variables|Any grouping variables needed to define unique PK profiles for analysis|
Data sorting|This will by default include the columns for "Unique Subject/Animal Identifier" and "Time". If additional columns are needed to properly sort the data in each unique PK profile, please add them here|
