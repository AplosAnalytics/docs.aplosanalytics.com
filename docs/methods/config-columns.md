|Concentration Observed|Observed concentration that includes text designations for samples below the limit of quantitation or missing samples|Required|
|Concentration Analyzed|Concentration to be used in the calculation of PK parameters. Imputations for missing samples and/or samples below the limit of quantation must be made in this column|Required|
|Grouping variables|Any grouping variables needed to define unique PK profiles for analysis|1 column is required, additional columns are optional. For sparse data, Unique ID is ignored as a grouping variable, and thus at least one other grouping variable must be provided.|
|Sorting|This is how the data is sorted prior to analysis for each unique profile. Generally include the time column variable. This column has been removed from the web user interface as it is generally not needed.|1 column is required, additional columns are optional|
|Custom/Carry Along Values|These are columns with information that will be added to the output files, but is not used group grouping. All grouping variables are automatically added as Custom variables during the analysis by the Aplos NCA engine. This ensures that all grouping variables are included in the output datasets.|Optional|
|Exclusion Column|This column is used to exclude data from the analysis. Select the column that has the exclusion codes.|Optional|
|Exclusion Code|This is the code for exclusions within the selected exclusion column. For example, it may be "N" or it may be the number "1". Only a single exclusion code is permitted. |Optional. Required if Exclusion column is selected.|
