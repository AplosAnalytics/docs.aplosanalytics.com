# Kel Configuration
(image of kel configuration screen)\

On this screen the user sets the rules by which the best-fit terminal elimination rate constant is selected by Aplos NCA. The best-fit rate constant must meet all of the criteria specified. If multiple rate constants fit the criteria, the one with the largest statistic value (either r<sup>2</sup> or adjusted r<sup>2</sup>) will be selected. If two or more rate constants have the same statistic value, then the tie-breaker rules are used. A description of each setting on the Kel configuration screen is below:
