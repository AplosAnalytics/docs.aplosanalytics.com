# ðŸŸ¢ Kel Configuration

On this screen (Figure 1) the user sets the rules by which the best-fit terminal elimination rate constant is selected by Aplos NCA. 

**Figure 1: Kel rules configuration screen**

The best-fit rate constant must meet all of the criteria specified. If multiple rate constants fit the criteria, the one with the largest statistic value (either r<sup>2</sup> or adjusted r<sup>2</sup>) will be selected. If two or more rate constants have the same statistic value, then the tie-breaker rules are used. A description of each setting on the Kel configuration screen is below:

## Description of input fields
|Field name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Regression statistic|Choose either r<sup>2</sup> or adjusted r<sup>2</sup>. The default is [adjusted r<sup>2</sup>](#adjusted-r2-calculation) as it gives a small penalty for each additional time point included in the regression.|
|Minimum statistic value|The chosen statistic must be greater than this value. Default is 0, meaning it is not used. Number must be less than 1.|
|Maximum % extrapolated for AUC<sub>infinity</sub> Linear|The % extrapolated for the AUC<sub>infinity</sub> calculated using the linear method must be less than this value. Default is 0, meaning it is not used. Number must be greater than 0 and less than 100.|
|Maximum % extrapolated for AUC<sub>infinity</sub> LinLog|The % extrapolated for the AUC<sub>infinity</sub> calculated using the linear up log down method must be less than this value. Default is 0, meaning it is not used. Number must be greater than 0 and less than 100.|
|Minimum Span|Minimum value for the Span variable. Default is 0, meaning it is not used. Any values greater than 0 are accepted.|
|Maximum number of points|Maximum number of time points permitted in the regression. Default is 0, meaning it is not used. Any values greater than 0 are accepted. Note that all regressions have a minimum of 3 data points.|
|Earliest time point|Earliest time point included in the regression. Default is 0, meaning it is not used.|
|Tie|Used if 2 regressions have identical values for the statistic. Default first tie-breaker is fewest number of data points. Default second tie-breaker is the latest time for the starting time point in the regression. User can switch the order of these tie-breakers.|

## Adjusted r<sup>2</sup> Calculation
The adjusted r<sup>2</sup> is calculated using the r<sup>2</sup> from the regression and the number of data points included in the regresssion (n):
::: info Equation
$\text{Adjusted }r^2 = 1 - (1 - r^2)*\frac{n-1}{n-2}$
:::
The fraction $\frac{n-1}{n-2}$ will always be slightly larger than 1, thus the adjusted r<sup>2</sup> will always be slightly smaller than r<sup>2</sup>. And as n gets larger, the effect becomes greater. This means that regressions with smaller number of points are preferred over ones with many points.
