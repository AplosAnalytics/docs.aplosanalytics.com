# ðŸŸ£ Meta Data

Meta data can be attached to any analysis by the user and is searchable to permit quick identification of analyses of interest. All meta data is user-defined and there is no limit to the number or complexity of meta data descriptions. Meta data must be added at the time of analysis and cannot be updated later.

> [!NOTE]
> Search capability on meta data is not available during the Early Access Program. It will be available when Aplos NCA is available for subscription.

## Input for web configuration
<div style="position: relative; box-sizing: content-box; max-height: 80vh; max-height: 80svh; width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 1.7818627450980393; padding: 40px 0 40px 0;"><iframe src="https://guides.aplosanalytics.com/embed/cm6wiuryr02013wrqxzytu3q2?embed_v=2" loading="lazy" title="Meta data" allow="clipboard-write" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

> [!TIP]
> Make sure you click the :heavy_plus_sign: button after entering your key:value pair. If a trash can does not appear next to your key:value pair, it will not be included in the analysis.


## Manual JSON structure
If you are performing analysis using a formatted JSON file, you must structure the meta data using standard JSON structures. You can create arrays (and nested arrays) for the meta data if desired. One example is shown below:

```js
{
  "compound": "IX-123",
  "study": "CL-123-004",
  "project": "psoriasis",
  "type-of-analysis": "interim-analysis",
  "team": [
        {
            "name": "john doe",
            "title": "lead analyst",
            "company": "little pharma"
        },
        {
            "name": "jane doe",
            "title": "consultant",
            "company": "acme consulting"
        }
    ]
}
```
In the example, there are 5 keys: "compound", "study", "project", "type-of-analysis", and "team". The values after the colon (\:) are the values assigned to those keys. The key "team" includes an array of 2 values, each with a set of 3 key:value pairs.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not use spaces in either the keys or the values. Spaces create challenges when searching for information from the database in the future. We recommend using a dash (-) instead of a space.


## Recommendations
It is recommended that you attept to standardize on both the keys and values across your organization for the greatest benefit. However, it is impossible to predict every bit of information that might be needed in the future. We recommend development of a key:value guide for users and the preparation of a standard meta data json file that is readily available for all users. Since these values are stored as text, you may need to employ creative searching algorithms to capture inconsistent formatting across multiple users (e.g. IX-123 and IX123 may be used by different individuals)
