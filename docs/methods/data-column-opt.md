# Optional Columns
Columns for grouping data are optional, but may be necessary for a specific analysis. All grouping columns are carried through to the results. Grouping columns can contain any alphanumeric information; however, the values should be the same for each unique profile for a single subject. You may specify as many grouping columns as needed. Examples of grouping variables are listed below:
    -   Sex
    -   Treatment
    -   Formulation
    -   Period
    -   Dose level
