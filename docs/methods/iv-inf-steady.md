# ðŸ©ºðŸ©º IV Infusion Steady State
For IV Infusion administration at steady state, the following parameters are calculated as described. The term steady state means that the rate of input and rate of elimination of the drug are equivalent; however, there is nothing in the data of a single dosing interval that can independently determine if steady state has been achieved. A user must confirm that steady state has been achieved by other methods (e.g. monitoring trough values over several dosing intervals).

## Imputations
If the analysis dataset does not include a concentration value at the time of dose administration, a value will be imputed from the dataset. That value will be the minimum observed concentration between the time of dose administration and dose administration plus the dosing interval (Tau). The imputed concentration will be added to the dataset with a time value equal to the time of dose administration. This value is used in all parameter calculations.

If the analysis dataset does not include a concentration value at time Tau, a value will be imputed from the dataset. That value will be extrapolated from the last time point prior to Tau using the terminal elimination rate constant as described in [extrapolation methods](./extrapolationmethods).
