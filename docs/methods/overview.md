Aplos NCA is a secure cloud API with audit trails for all analyses. This documentation is divided into 2 parts: (1) documentation of the NCA methods implemented, and (2) [technical details on how to interact with the API](/docs/api/). 

This overview will describe the basic operation of Aplos NCA using the Aplos web interface. Subsequent sections include details about each aspect of the API and how to interact with it using a variety of tools such as R, SAS, and Python.
