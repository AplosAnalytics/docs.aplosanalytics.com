# ðŸŽ© Professional Accounts
Professional accounts are designed for individual users who do not need to collaborate with other analysts for PK analysis with NCA methods. Each account is limited to a single user and up to 100 analyses per year. 

## Number of analyses
Each Professional account is allocated a specific number of analyses during the 12-month subscription period. Only <button style="background-color: #5AA745; color: #fff1f2; border-radius: 12px; padding: 2.5px 10px;" name="button">Complete</button> analyses are counted against the allocation. Analyses with a status of <button style="background-color: #ff5757; color: #fff1f2; border-radius: 12px; padding: 2.5px 10px;" name="button">Failed</button> are not counted against the allocation. To determine the number of analyses remaining, the number of <button style="background-color: #5AA745; color: #fff1f2; border-radius: 12px; padding: 2.5px 10px;" name="button">Complete</button> analyses along with the number of analyses currently ongoing are subtracted from the allocation. An example is below:

:::info Calculation of Analyses Remaining
**Annual Allocation:** 50 analyses\
**Completed:** 22 analyses\
**Ongoing:** 1 analysis\
**Remaining:** 27 analyses (50 - 22 - 1 = 27)
:::

## Additional analyses
Additional analyses can be added to the allocation by contacting the Aplos Analytics sales team (<sales@aplosanalytics.com>). The additional analyses are availabel during the 12-month subscription period and expire at the end of the subscription. 

## Renewal
All Professional accounts are automatically renewed for an additional 12-month period at the same analysis allocation at the current subscription price. Invoices will be sent 30 days prior to the beginning of the new subscription period. If payment is not received prior to the end of the subscription period, the account will be suspended until payment is received.

## Upgrading Account
A Professional account can be upgraded to a larger analysis allocation at any time. The user will be credited for the proportion of analyses not used toward the new account cost. The new account will begin a new 12-month subscription period with the new analysis allocation. An example is below

:::info Example
**Current subscription:** Professional - 25 analyses per year\
**Current remaining analyses:** 10 analyses\
**New subscription:** Professional - 100 analyses per year\
**Credit toward new subscription:** 10/25 = 40%\
40% of current subscription fees can be applied toward the new subscription cost
:::

If a user upgrades from a Professional account to a Team or Enterprise account, credit toward the new subscription will be provided; however, input data, analysis results, and audit trails cannot be tranferred from Professional accounts to Team or Enterpreise accounts. Aplos Analytics will facilitate the download of all files from the Professional account and upload to the new Team/Enterprise account. Charges for that service will be provided to the user before transfers begin.

## Downgrading Account and Account Cancellation
Downgrading the number of analyses per year can be done during the renewal period. If an account is cancelled, you will retain access to the tool through the end of the subscription period. At the end of the subscription period, your access will be terminated and the data in the account will be scheduled for destruction. There are no refunds for cancellations prior to the end of the subscription period.
