# NCA Methods

NCA parameters are calculated for each unique pharmacokinetic profile in the analysis dataset. Unique profiles are determined by the unique combinations of the subject identifier column and all unique values of each sort variable provided in the configuration. The parameters calculated for each route of administration and dosing frequency are included in the following pages:

- [IV Bolus - single dose](IVBolusSingleDose.md)
- [IV Infusion - single dose](IVInfusionSingleDose.md)
- [Extravascular administration - single dose](ExtravascularSingleDose.md)
- [IV Bolus - steady state](IVBolusSteadyState.md)
- [IV Infusion - steady state](IVInfusionSteadyState.md)
- [Extravascular administration - steady state](ExtravascularSteadyState.md)
