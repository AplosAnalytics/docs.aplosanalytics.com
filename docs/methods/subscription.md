Subscriptions define what and when a user can access files and tools within the Aplos NCA system. Subscriptions are assigned one of for status levels. The four status levels and the restrictions for each are described below.

## Active

* Conduct analyses

Users will not be able to download analysis results until the subscription is converted to Active. 

## Expired

Users will not be able to upload input datasets nor will they be able to execute an analysis. After 60 days, users will not be able to do anything.

A disabled subscription means that users have no access to the system. This status is applied to expired accounts after approximately 90 days and until deletion from the system.
