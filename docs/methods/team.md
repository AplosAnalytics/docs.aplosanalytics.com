# Team Accounts
Team accounts are designed for companies that have multiple users who need to perform PK analysis with NCA methods. Team accounts have a limit of 50 unique users. 

## Number of analyses
Each Team account is allocated a specific number of analyses during the 12-month subscription period. Only <span style="background-color:green;color:white">Completed</span> analyses are counted against the allocation. Analyses with a status of <span style="background-color:red;color:white">Failed</span> are not counted against the allocation. To determine the number of analyses remaining, the number of <span style="background-color:green;color:white">Completed</span> analyses along with the number of analyses currently ongoing are subtracted from the allocation. The number of <span style="background-color:green;color:white">Completed</span> analyses are collected across all users in the Team account. An example is below:

:::info Calculation of Analyses Remaining
**Allocation:** 200 analyses\
**User 1 Completed:** 22 analyses\
**User 2 Completed:** 10 analyses\
**User 3 Completed:** 56 analyses\
**Ongoing (all users):** 5 analysis\
**Remaining:** 107 analyses (200 - 22 - 10 - 56 - 5 = 107)
:::

## Additional analyses
Additional analyses can be added to the allocation by contacting the Aplos Analytics sales team (<sales@aplosanalytics.com>). The additional analyses are availabel during the 12-month subscription period and expire at the end of the subscription. 

## Renewal
All Team accounts are automatically renewed for an additional 12-month period at the same analysis allocation at the current subscription price. Invoices will be sent 30 days prior to the beginning of the new subscription period. If payment is not received prior to the end of the subscription period, the account will be suspended until payment is received.

## Upgrading Account
A Team account can be upgraded to a larger analysis allocation at any time. The Team will be credited for the proportion of analyses not used toward the new account cost. The new account will begin a new 12-month subscription period with the new analysis allocation. An example is below

:::info Example
**Current subscription:** Team - 200 analyses per year\
**Current remaining analyses:** 50 analyses\
**New subscription:** Team - 800 analyses per year\
**Credit toward new subscription:** 50/200 = 25%\
25% of current subscription fees can be applied toward the new subscription cost

Team accounts can be upgraded to Enterprise accounts. 

## Downgrading Account
Team accounts cannot be downgraded to Professional accounts. Downgrading the number of analyses per year can be done during the renewal period.
