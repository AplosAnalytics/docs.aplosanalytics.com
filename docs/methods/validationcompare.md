# ðŸ†š Validation comparison

The comparison procedure within the validation process calculates the relative difference for all numerical output generated by Aplos NCA. The relative difference is calculated using the following equation:

$\text{Relative Difference \%}=100 * [{{test} - {known} \over {known}}]$

Any difference between the test value and the known value that is greater than 0.01% will be flagged as a test failure. If no test failures are identified within a test case, then the test case is considered a pass. The process is repeated for each of the 6 test cases. All 6 test cases must pass for the overall validation result to pass. Failure of even one test case is considered a validation failure.
