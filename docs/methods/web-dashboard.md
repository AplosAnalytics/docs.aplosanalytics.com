## Allocated Amount Used
The top left of the Dashboard shows the number of completed analyses relative to the total number of analyses available as part of your subscription. Only <span style="background-color:green;color:white">Completed</span> analyses are counted against the allocation. Analyses with a status of <span style="background-color:red;color:white">Failed</span> are not counted against the allocation. Any analyses that are currently in process are against the allocated amount used, and removed from that calculation if a failure occurs.

## Remaining Analyses
This is the number of analyses remaining for the subscription period.

## Completed Analyses
This is the number of <span style="background-color:green;color:white">Completed</span> analyses for this user.

## Failed Analyses
This is the number of <span style="background-color:red;color:white">Failed</span> analyses for this user.

## Recent Analysis
Below the presentation of <span style="background-color:green;color:white">Completed</span> and <span style="background-color:red;color:white">Failed</span> analyses is a list of the five most recent analyses where you can directly download the results by clicking the download button.
