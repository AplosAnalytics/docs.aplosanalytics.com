## Allocated Amount Used
The top left of the Dashboard shows the number of completed analyses relative to the total number of analyses available as part of your subscription. Only <button style="background-color: #5AA745; color: #fff1f2; border-radius: 12px; padding: 2.5px 10px;" name="button">Complete</button> analyses are counted against the allocation. Analyses with a status of <button style="background-color: #ff5757; color: #fff1f2; border-radius: 12px; padding: 2.5px 10px;" name="button">Failed</button> are not counted against the allocation. Any analyses that are currently in process are against the allocated amount used, and removed from that calculation if a failure occurs.
