## Load Previous Analysis
There are occassions where you may want to re-run an analysis with a few changes. The redo icon under the Action column for each analysis will reload the configuration screen with the previous settings. You can then make changes to the analysis (e.g. add a grouping column, or add meta data) and execute the new analysis. The new analysis results will then appear in the Analysis History page. This action does not modify or change the original analysis in any way.
