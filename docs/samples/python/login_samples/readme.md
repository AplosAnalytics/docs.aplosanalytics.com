# Login Samples


Here you will find two quick samples to help you understand the login process.

|File Name|Description|
|--|--|
|cognito_login_boto3.py|Uses the boto3 library to connect to Amazon Cognito|
|congito_login_http_post.py|Uses standard https requests to connecto to Amazon Cognito|

Either framework works as expected.
